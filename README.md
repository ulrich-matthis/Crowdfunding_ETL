# Crowdfunding_ETL

For this repository the goal was to put into practice the skills obtained during the most recent modules of my
coding bootcamp experience and this project was also completed in a group setting with some of my classmates. This project
was completed using jupyter notebook for data extraction and cleaning and preparation of tables which were exported into the
resources folder as csv files. The second portion of this project included creating a database and corresponding schema
using pgAdmin4 with "SELECT *" statements following table creations to verify data imports were successful.

The data used for this project involved two original xlsm files, one with crowdfunding data and the second contained corresponding
contact info which proved to be very important following database creation. Both of these original files are available within the  
Resources folder.
